# âœ… Phase 1: Core Foundation â€“ Build and Understand the Stack
## Goal: Launch a working Zabbix monitoring system using Docker Compose.

This part consist of:

Docker Compose (volumes, networks, depends_on, environment)

Zabbix basics (server, frontend, login, items, hosts)

MySQL basics (used by Zabbix)

.env files (to manage secrets/configs)

Basic Linux networking & port mapping

After clone this, you can have a full Zabbix by doing this: ðŸ˜‰

        docker compose up -d


# âœ… Phase 2: Observability and Reverse Proxy
## Goal: Add visibility and secure access

This part consist of:

Zabbix Agent (deployed inside containers or on host)

Monitoring Docker host/container metrics

Grafana (connect to Zabbix DB, create dashboards)

Nginx or Traefik as reverse proxy with optional HTTPS

How to expose services properly (ports, SSL, domains)

# âœ… Phase 3: Production Readiness & Resilience
## Goal: Automate health, backups, and configurations

This part consist of:

Cron jobs for health checks or DB dumps

Backup strategies (Restic, mysqldump, volume mount backups)

Git for versioning Docker configurations

CI/CD basics with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

Secrets management (.env, volumes, and Docker secrets)

# âœ… Phase 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
## Goal: Automate your entire deployment â€” from provisioning to services

This part consist of:

Terraform: Provision cloud VM or local KVM machine

Ansible: Install Docker, copy configs, deploy Compose stack

Combine Terraform + Ansible for full automation

Optionally test with Molecule (advanced)

# ðŸ§  Optional Advanced Enhancements 

This part consist of:

Alerting integrations (Slack, Telegram from Zabbix)

Docker Swarm or Kubernetes (intro level)

Use MinIO for object storage + backup testing

Logging with Loki + Promtail (Grafana stack)
